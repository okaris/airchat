## what is this

airchat was a simple ios app i built in 2013 that let people chat directly using airdrop. no servers, no signups, just devices talking to each other. it worked. it was fun. it got rejected.

## the story

in 2013, i built a prototype ios chat app that used airdrop to send messages directly between devices. the idea was to create a local, offline-first messaging experience with zero setup.

i submitted it to the app store. it got rejected.

they said i wasn’t using *public* apis the way they wanted. no further explanation. then i got a call — someone from the review team told me the leadership team had discussed it and decided that they didn’t want airdrop used this way. end of story.

i shelved it. but i never forgot.

## why now

i recently found the original project buried in an old backup hdd. so here it is. for curiosity, for history, for fun. maybe someone can learn something from it. maybe it’ll inspire something new.

## disclaimer

this is old code. don’t expect it to build out of the box. airdrop internals may have changed. ios has changed. the world has changed. this is for archival and reference purposes only.

## license

unlicensed. do what you want with it.
